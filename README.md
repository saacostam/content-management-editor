# Content Management Editor with React

- Editor for managing content using react.

### TODO

- [ ] Recover Strict Mode
  - [ ] Might require to flatten/normalize the data structures that are currently nested.
- [ ] Editor - Content Blocks: The domain logic for accessing the current tile and/or content block shares significant similarities. Abstracting this logic could be beneficial to avoid repetition and improve maintainability in case it's reused elsewhere.
- [ ] Editot - Content Blocks - Edit Form: Maybe centralize submit button in a common layout component.
